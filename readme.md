# GPHtml
## Fork of LaravelCollective's HTML package for Laravel

Did this mostly to keep the project alive and to get rid of those composer warnings.

Yes i know about spartie but that package docs is confusing, not facade friendly and seem to not have the Form::open i want

No code changes yet just a change from v6 to v7 and Class name change from Collective to GP

Oh and PHP min is 8.1
